## About

This is a UG Minor course. You would be introduced about basic machine learning methods in this course.
- Prerequisites: Strong hold on **linear algebra and probability**. If you really think that you are not good at it, better fix it and then come back to the class next year. This is NOT an _elementary machine learning course_. We will cover stuffs with depth, hold on semi-advanced maths are strongly recommended.
- **No Provision for Audit**
- Resources from previous offering: [Spring 2020](https://rebrand.ly/cs419-2021)

## Lectures

This course will run in **online mode**. Live lectures will be taken on MS Teams. Recordings of these lectures will be made available for usage.
- TAs will share a Google form for submitting doubts. We will collate them and address by group. Forms will be shared every week. In person 1-1 meetings seem grim.
